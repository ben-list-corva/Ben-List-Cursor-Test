# Directional Projection (Projected Survey Stations)

Projected survey stations generated by Auto Projection Scheduler or Survey Projection Calculator. This collection contains forward projections of the wellbore trajectory based on current drilling parameters, toolface orientation, and motor yield. Projections help directional drillers anticipate where the wellbore will be at the next survey depth.

## When to use this dataset

- You need projected wellbore positions ahead of current depth.
- You want to anticipate wellbore position at next survey.
- You need projection data for anti-collision calculations.
- You want to evaluate different drilling scenarios.
- You need to plan directional adjustments based on projections.

## Example queries

### Alerting
- Alert when projected trajectory shows potential collision.
- Notify when projection indicates deviation from target zone.
- Alert when projected dogleg severity exceeds limits.

### Visualization
- Display projected wellbore path ahead of current position.
- Show multiple projection scenarios for decision support.
- Chart projected vs planned trajectory at future depths.

### Q&A
- Where will the wellbore be at the next survey depth?
- What is the projected distance to plan at target?
- Will current drilling parameters keep us on target?
- What toolface would be needed to correct course?

## Frequency

`per_projection` (updated when new projections are calculated)

## Primary keys and meaning

- `timestamp`: Unix/epoch timestamp when the projection was calculated.
- `asset_id`: Unique ID of the asset (well) for filtering a specific well.

## Available fields
