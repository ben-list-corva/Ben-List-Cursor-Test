# Directional Guidance (Drilling Recommendations)

Directional drilling guidance recommendations generated by automated systems or predictive algorithms. This dataset provides recommended drilling parameters, toolface orientations, and steering instructions to help directional drillers keep the wellbore on target while optimizing drilling performance.

## When to use this dataset

- You need automated directional drilling recommendations.
- You want to see suggested toolface and slide lengths.
- You need guidance for staying on target trajectory.
- You want to optimize directional drilling decisions.
- You need predictive recommendations for course corrections.

## Example queries

### Alerting
- Alert when guidance recommends course correction.
- Notify when recommended parameters change significantly.
- Alert when guidance indicates potential target miss.

### Visualization
- Display recommended toolface and slide length.
- Show guidance recommendations vs actual parameters.
- Chart recommended trajectory corrections.
- Overlay guidance on directional trend display.

### Q&A
- What toolface does the system recommend?
- How long should the next slide be?
- What course correction is needed to hit target?
- Are current parameters aligned with guidance?
- What is the confidence level of the recommendation?

## Frequency

`per_update` (generated when drilling conditions or position updates)

## Primary keys and meaning

- `timestamp`: Unix/epoch timestamp when guidance was generated.
- `asset_id`: Unique ID of the asset (well) for filtering a specific well.

## Available fields

### Top-level fields

- `timestamp` (long): Unix/epoch timestamp of the guidance.
- `asset_id` (int): Unique asset ID.
- `company_id` (int): Company identifier.

### `data` fields (inferred from domain knowledge)

- `data.recommended_toolface` (float): Recommended toolface orientation.
- `data.recommended_slide_length` (float): Recommended slide footage.
- `data.recommended_mode` (string): Recommended drilling mode ("slide" or "rotate").
- `data.current_distance_to_plan` (float): Current deviation from planned trajectory.
- `data.projected_distance_to_plan` (float): Projected deviation if recommendations followed.
- `data.build_needed` (float): Inclination change needed.
- `data.turn_needed` (float): Azimuth change needed.
- `data.correction_urgency` (string): Urgency level of correction ("low", "medium", "high").
- `data.target_depth` (float): Target measured depth for guidance.
- `data.target_inclination` (float): Target inclination at guidance depth.
- `data.target_azimuth` (float): Target azimuth at guidance depth.
- `data.confidence` (float): Confidence level of the recommendation (inferred).
- `data.model_version` (string): Version of guidance model used (inferred).
