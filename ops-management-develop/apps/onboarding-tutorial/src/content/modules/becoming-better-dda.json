Users can filter by Rig Release Date, Program, Basin, County, Target Formation, Rig, String Design, Conventional or Rotary Steerable Systems, and Directional Company. This app uses large data sets to help customers compare performance between rig contractors in the fleet, compare performance in a particular hole size or well section, and identify performance improvement over time. The app can also be used to easily identify bad data in an asset by identifying outliers in the data set (i.e if On-Bottom ROP shows 1200 ft/hr, but the average or the dataset is 180 ft/hr)."

The BHA Optimization app allows users to perform offset analysis of BHAs for a given basin, target formation, hole section, hole size, and inclination range. Users can also filter to BHAs within a given radius of an offset well to analyze the best BHAs within a given region. Once the BHAs of interest have been identified, users can compare parameters that were used for that BHA using the box and whisker plot that shows the distribution of the drilling parameters for that specific BHA."
