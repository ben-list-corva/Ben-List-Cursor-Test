Corva can be used to identify trends in rig performance and drive improvement by displaying the data in visually pleasing and intuitive applications within the Corva platform. Drilling optimization is also achieved by using Corva's database of offset wells and identifying optimal drilling parameters that maximize rate of penetration. With Corva, drilling engineers can reduce drilling and slide time, identify problem events using automated alerts, and mine historical data to discover the best practices for drilling each formation and area."
