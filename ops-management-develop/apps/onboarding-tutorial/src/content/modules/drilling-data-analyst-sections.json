The calibration tool in the BHA edit should closely resemble the Hookload Broomstick app and the Circulating Pressure Loss app. On occasion the calibration tool will not display data, in that case the Hookload Broomstick app and Circulating Pressure Loss app will need to be used to calibrate the BHA, the only difference with using the apps vs the calibration tool is the changes will need to be saved then the apps will need to be allowed time to update and reflect the changes, the calibration tool will display the values before saving and will not require time to update. \n[IMAGE:/training-assets/1uqwWg1IUqPjbePmSUBjl0ZLfWNqwfj9ndRy4aTMlR_0/775098eb908f.png:Figure 55]\n\n[IMAGE:/training-assets/1uqwWg1IUqPjbePmSUBjl0ZLfWNqwfj9ndRy4aTMlR_0/86f48d3e730c.png:Figure 17]"

If the predicted pressure needs to be increased the pressure loss values can be increased (if the flow rate is already set to the minimum value). If the predicted pressure needs to be decreased the flow rate can be increased within the operating range of the motor (the pressure losses should be set to 150psi for the motor and 100pis for all other components with a pressure loss before increasing the flow rate). If the BHA does not have a motor the flow rate range for the string is normally reported on the BHA tally in the MWD comments. The flow rate used should match for all components that have a pressure loss entry. If the DDA is not able to get the CPL divergence within 10% by adjusting the pressure loss and flow rate values on these components the other things that affect predicted SPP should be verified. .If the DDA is still not able to get the CPL divergence within 10% after verifying ODs/IDs, mud, surveys, bit jets, and motor specs the engineering specialist should be notified\n\n[IMAGE:/training-assets/1uqwWg1IUqPjbePmSUBjl0ZLfWNqwfj9ndRy4aTMlR_0/76a0f000335f.png:Figure 118]\n\n[IMAGE:/training-assets/1uqwWg1IUqPjbePmSUBjl0ZLfWNqwfj9ndRy4aTMlR_0/8d2a8ab1efd8.png:Figure 4]"

Additionally, the casing weights should not be manipulated in the same way that drill pipe can be, therefore surface and intermediate casing strings will not have very many variables that can be adjusted to make the points line up. Casing strings are often not rotated down, especially surface and intermediate strings, so the slack off points will likely be the majority of the points on the hookload broomstick and observed friction factors can vary depending on hole conditions. As a result, calibrating surface and intermediate casing strings is not required, however the DDA should strive to make the model as accurate as possible (verify mud weight, block weight, casing weight, and surveys)."

For BHAs, motor specs need to be correct before drilling starts because this will affect the MSE values that get stored to the database. Additionally the items that affect the CPL model need to be entered before drilling starts as these are used to calculate the predicted SPP value which is also stored in the database. For casing runs, the hookload model will no longer update if there is no pipe movement. A rerun is required to fix these issues if not addressed in time. Therefore, the DDA may be required to update BHA and casing from time to time."

In the situation where check shots are being uploaded the DDA may be able to turn full update off and manually remove the check shot or overwrite the existing surveys with the approved surveys from the data inbox.

A good rule of thumb is more than 5 new surveys will probably be fastest to just upload a file.

Since customer facing tech support is the DDAs #1 priority the DDA should keep a window with Intercom open at all times with audible notifications turned on. To help keep track of well connections the DDA can use the WITSML provider’s EDR (if available) to monitor when new wells start. For clients that do not have an EDR the DDA will need to keep track of the wells that are offline and have a process for checking PDS on a regular basis to ensure well connections are made in a timely manner; going through the wells in the  Mission Control app on a regular time interval is useful for this. To ensure that BHAs and casing strings get activated on time, it is recommended that the DDA should have a window open with a tab for each rig that is tripping out, however any method the DDA can devise to reliably activate BHAs and casing strings at surface is acceptable. The Mission Control and the Well Check Up apps have errors that will let the DDA know if the next run is prepared (the “Add a PH BHA” error). Paying attention to this error can further help the DDA with activations as this indicates that Corva does not have something to activate on its own if it detects the rig has started to trip back in. BHA calibrations are somewhat less time sensitive and there are errors in the Mission Control and Well Check Up apps that can be used to draw the DDA’s attention. Beyond the event based tasks that were covered above, the DDA should go through all of their rigs once every 2 hours to see if any conditions have changed and to update the handover notes in the Mission Control app as needed. The DDA is not required to conform to a set workflow so long as these tasks are completed and prioritized correctly. The main tools provided to the DDA are the Mission Control app, Well Check Up app, and Company Dashboards."

In addition to keeping notes the Mission Control app also has filters and a search function that are designed to help the DDA quickly find notes on a well and navigate to that well.\n\n[IMAGE:/training-assets/1uqwWg1IUqPjbePmSUBjl0ZLfWNqwfj9ndRy4aTMlR_0/305475e336e3.png:Figure 137]"
